# Dice game built using CQRS & EventSourcing with Akka.NET

It's a really simple (yet complete) event-sourced game. 
The rules are:
- game creator specifies players taking part
- each player, one after another, has an opportunity to roll the dice
- each playerâ€™s opportunity to roll is timeboxed, if a player didn't roll on time, his opportunity is gone
- winners are all players that rolled the highest number

This workshop is a .NET Core 3 port based on https://scalac.io/event-sourced-game-implementation-example-part-1-3-getting-started/

_DISCLAIMER:_
<br/>
_The code in this repository is created to demonstrate some core concept about CQRS and Event Sourcing using Akka.NET
in the context of experimentation, this code is far from production-ready!_
